/* Programming Assignment 4: Exercise C
 *
 * You are ready to begin building a user-level thread package.  Your task is
 * to implement the functions: MyInitThreads (), MyCreateThread (func, param),
 * MyYieldThread (t), MyGetThread (), MySchedThread (), and MyExitThread ().
 * They should work in a general way, supporting MAXTHREADS active threads.
 * Note that a program may create more than MAXTHREADS threads, as long as
 * no more than MAXTHREADS threads are active at any point in time.
 *
 * You are given a test program below.  It currently references thread
 * functions that are properly implemented, i.e., CreateThread, YieldThread,
 * etc., which mirror the ones you are to implement.  Eventually, you
 * should replace all of them with reference to your functions by simply
 * prefixing each one with "My", e.g., "CreateThread" becomes "MyCreateThread".
 * Note that you cannot mix your functions with the working ones, so you
 * must replace all of them.
 *
 * 
 * Some notes:
 *
 * 1. MyInitThreads () should initialize all your thread management data
 * structures.  Here is where you may wish to reserve stack space FOR THE
 * MAXIMUM NUMBER OF THREADS that may be active at any one time (MAXTHREADS).
 *
 * 2. MyCreateThread should return the ID of the thread just created (assuming
 * no errors).  In Exercise B, it was assumed the return value was 1 because it
 * could only create a single thread (with ID 1); this needs to be generalized
 * to any value between 0 and MAXTHREADS-1.  If there is an error, such as if
 * there are already MAXTHREADS active threads (and no more can be created
 * until one or more exit), MyCreateThread should simply return -1.
 * IMPORTANT: Threads IDs should be integers that are assigned in increasing
 * order.  The initial thread (that exists by default) is thread 0.  The first
 * time MyCreateThread is called, it should create thread 1, and each subsequent
 * (successful) call to MyCreateThread, regardless of which thread makes the
 * call, should assign IDs 2, 3, ... 9, i.e., up to and including MAXTHREADS-1
 * (for MAXTHREADS equal to 10 in this example).  Values should be reused
 * AFTER having reached MAXTHREADS-1, again starting from 0 and incrementing
 * by 1, but a value that is in use should be skipped over (and thus not
 * assigned to a new thread since it is already the ID of an active one).
 * The result is that each active thread will have a unique ID between 0 and
 * MAXTHREADS-1 inclusive.  Note the increasing order of assignment and
 * incrementing by 1 (this is very important, as our test programs will expect
 * this order of ID assignment).
 *
 * Here is an example for clarification: say MAXTHREADS = 10, and seven
 * threads are created: 0, 1, 2, ..., 6. Next, threads 2 and 5 exit. Next
 * four threads are created: 7, 8, 9, and 2. Since 0 and 1 still exist,
 * those IDs are skipped over. Next 0 and 3 exit. Next three threads are
 * created. Since the last ID assigned was 2, and since 3 is the next
 * available, the three threads are assigned the following IDs: 3, 5 and 0.
 *
 * 3. MyYieldThread (t) needs to be generalized so that any thread can yield
 * to any other thread, including itself.  Also, the ID of the calling thread
 * must be properly returned, or -1 if t is invalid.  To clarify this further,
 * consider a program of many threads, two of which are threads 3 and 7.
 *
 * Thread 3 contains the statement:
 *
 * x = MyYieldThread (7);	// causes thread 3 to yield to thread 7
 *
 * Thread 7 contains the statement:
 * 
 * x = MyYieldThread (t);	// causes thread 7 to yield to thread t
 *
 * Assume that at some point in the past, thread 7 had run and had executed
 * its yield statement as shown above.  To what it yields to is not shown
 * as it depends on the value of t.  If t equalled 3, then control would
 * have gone to thread 3.  If it were another value, another thread would
 * have gotten control.  Regardless, assume that thread 3 is now running,
 * and executes its yield statement as shown above.  At this point, control
 * is given to thread 7, which returns from its yield statement with x set
 * to 3 (because it was thread 3 that yielded to thread 7).  The value of
 * x that will be set in thread 3 when its yield statement returns will
 * depend on whatever other thread eventually yields to it.
 *
 * 4. MySchedThread () is similar to MyYieldThread, except that MySchedThread
 * determines which thread to yield to, rather than this being specified via
 * a parameter as in MyYieldThread.  MySchedThread does not return any value.
 *
 * 5. IMPORTANT: MySchedThread should implement the FIFO (first-in-first-out)
 * scheduling discipline.  Thus, if a thread calls MySchedThread, it should
 * be placed at the end of a queue, and whichever thread is at the front
 * should be selected for execution (and of course removed from the queue).
 * If a thread calls MyYieldThread (t), then the calling thread should be
 * placed at the end of the queue, and t should be removed from the queue,
 * regardless of its position, and treated as if it were at the front, i.e.,
 * selected for execution and when it gives up the CPU, it should go to the
 * end of the queue.
 *
 * 6. MyExitThread () should cause the currently running thread to exit,
 * i.e., it should never run again, and its resources, such as its entry in
 * the thread table, should be reclaimed so that another thread may use them.
 * Finally, it may call MySchedThread () to pass control to another thread,
 * unless there is no thread to run, in which case it should call Exit ()
 * so that the Umix process properly completes.

 * 
 * WHAT TO TURN IN
 *
 * You must turn in one file: mythreads.c, which contains your user-level
 * thread implementation.
 *
 * Your programs will be tested with various Main programs that will exercise
 * your threads implementation.  As always, make sure you do as much rigorous
 * testing yourself to be sure your implementations are robust.
 *
 * While this assignment may be conceptually difficult, it does not require
 * a large amount of code.  The solution is roughly 100 lines of C code
 * (which include some comments) more than the version of mythreads.c that
 * was given to you.
 *
 * Good luck!
